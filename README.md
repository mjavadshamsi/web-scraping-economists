This repository contains materials from the workshop *Web Scraping for Economists*. The aim is to equip economists with the skills needed to gather data from websites for analysis.



# Web Scraping for Economists

I am an economist. In all my papers, I have used web scraping to assemble unique datasets, enabling me to explore questions that would otherwise remain inaccessible. I believe web scraping provides a powerful tool for assembling datasets and uncovering new insights, particularly in areas where traditional data sources are limited.

I have also provided workshops with practical takeaways from web scraping for economists and decided to share the content of those workshops here.


## My Research Projects Utilizing Web Scraping

Here is a list of my research projects where I employed web scraping as a key tool for data collection. Feel free to explore these works for examples of practical applications:

- [A New Order? Digital Disruption and Entrepreneurial Opportunities](https://www.javadshamsi.com/uploads/shamsi_JMP.pdf)
- [Immigration and Political Realignment](https://www.javadshamsi.com/uploads/immigration_shamsi.pdf)
- [Understanding Multi-Layered Sanctions: A Firm-Level Analysis](https://javadshamsi.com/uploads/sanctions_shamsi.pdf)
- [From Streets to Ballots: The Impact of Climate Protests on Public Awareness and Electoral Outcomes](https://javadshamsi.com/uploads/climate_protest.pdf) (with Azhar Hussain and Ranjana Sinha)



## Disclaimer

While web scraping is a powerful tool, it comes with responsibilities and nuances that must not be overlooked:
1. **Legal Considerations**: Always ensure compliance with website terms of service, intellectual property laws, and data privacy regulations.
2. **Ethical Concerns**: Respect the integrity and intentions of the data owner and avoid harmful practices like overloading servers or scraping sensitive information.
3. **Practical Limitations**: Web scraping can sometimes produce incomplete or biased datasets. Proper validation and supplementary data sources are often necessary.
4. **Technical Nuances**: Web scraping requires familiarity with HTML, CSS, and website structures, as well as awareness of potential pitfalls like dynamic content or anti-bot mechanisms.

Although I have applied web scraping in a practical sense for my research, it is crucial to approach it with care. I strongly recommend consulting additional resources to deepen your understanding and ensure that your work adheres to the highest standards of legality and ethics.
